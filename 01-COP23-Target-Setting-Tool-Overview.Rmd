# COP23 Target Setting Tool Overview

Welcome to the COP23 Target Setting Tool User Manual. The following pages aim to
provide users of the Target Setting Tool with the information necessary to
successfully complete each tab of the Target Setting Tool tool and determine
accurate, data-driven targets. For the past several years, the Target Setting Tool
has a been a key element of PEPFAR COP planning, and for COP23 serves a
critical function in assisting PEPFAR Country Teams in setting targets
in line with the UNAIDS 95-95-95 goals for Testing, Care & Treatment,
PMTCT, VMMC, OVC, and other program areas. Please note that the COP23
Target Setting Tool is mandatory and must be used to set targets for COP23. For
COP23, all indicators included in the Target Setting Tool are **MER 2.6**
indicators. For further information on the MER 2.6 indicators, please go
to <https://datim.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/200929315-MER>.

## About the Target Setting Tool

The COP23 Target Setting Tool supports analysis for all targets by Priority
Subnational Unit (PSNU), population, and Implementing Mechanism (IM).
This tool supports calculation of targets based on expected treatment
coverage rates by type of PSNU and population prioritization:

-   Attained

-   Scale-up: Aggressive

-   Scale-up: Saturation

-   Sustained

Prioritizations for PSNUs are based on COP Guidance section 7.3.2.ba.
These determine for a given PSNU programmatically what HIV treatment and
prevention services should be planned and informs both the overall
strategy and the targets. Teams must review and revise their PSNU
prioritization levels for COP23. The COP23 Target Setting Tool assumes a 'test and
start' treatment platform and will develop targets for achieving 95%
coverage in Scale up: Aggressive and Scale-up: Saturation PSNUs; all
other targets in the Target Setting Tool are based on the treatment targets,
insofar as the treatment targets are the main focus of reaching epidemic
control, and therefore relate to both testing and prevention targets.

The Target Setting Tool will allow PEPFAR teams to use country specific
programmatic assumptions to develop the optimal targets by PSNU along
the program cascades to ensure the necessary number of PLHIV are
diagnosed, linked, and start treatment. The Target Setting Tool does not
necessarily calculate targets for every indicator, but it has space for
teams to enter targets for all indicators and thus can be used to record
agreed-upon COP targets, even for non-calculated indicators.

**Teams must not modify the structure of the COP23 Target Setting Tool in any
way**. The Office of the US Global Aids Coordinator (OGAC) has developed
a process by which targets can be directly imported into DATIM via the
Target Setting Tool Site Tool in order to generate targets. However, this is *only*
possible for teams that do not in any way alter the structure or format
of the Target Setting Tool. Additional details are provided in COP Guidance and
will be available through COP webinars.

## Highlighted Changes from COP22 to COP23

The COP23 Target Setting Tool is largely the same as the COP21 Target Setting Tool. However,
please note the following updates that have been implemented as a result
of multiple feedback sessions with various country teams that had been
identified by the PRIME team, as well as new programmatic changes that
are reflected in the Section 7 of COP guidance. These changes revolve
around workflow, ease of target setting, and linkage to the COP guidance
based on different aspects of the Target Setting Tool that worked well and others
that did not during COP21 target stetting:

-   New Cascade Approach that will flow from Program Viral Load
    Suppression to testing to allow for countries closer or at Epi
    Control to more easily set targets, based on Section 7 of COP23
    Guidance.

-   Integration of new SNS Modalities for HTS and HTS_Recent.

-   Targets will no longer be set for PrEP_CURR, but instead will be set
    for a replacement indicator of PrEP_CT.

-   50+ finer age bands across the clinical cascade. These will be
    aggregated to 50+ upon DATIM import for all but TX_CURR.

-   **PSNUxIM tab structure** that will again handle de-duplication and
    IM allocation.

## Data Flow and Review Process to COP23 Submission

The results from APR20 have been taken from DATIM and used to populate
the Target Setting Tool. In turn, the Target Setting Tool targets will produce FY22 targets
that will be subsequently submitted through DATIM after COP23 has been
finalized and the PSNU level data entered into the Strategic Direction
Summary (SDS) tables, where appropriate (Target related data).

**Submission Process**

For each of the below submissions, the following process will occur:

-   Country Teamspre-validates their Target Setting Tool submission in the Target Setting Tool
    Self-Service App (available at <https://apps.datim.org/datapack/>).

-   Country Team uses Target Setting Tool Self-Service App to sync data with PAW
    Dossiers.

-   Country Team saves Target Setting Tool to SharePoint under the OU's HQ
    Collaboration > COP 2022 - FY 2023 > Guidance, Tools, and
    Resources folder.

-   Country Team submits a ticket in ZenDesk that includes:

    -   A link to the Target Setting Tool file saved in SharePoint

    -   Confirmation that this file has been pre-validated in the
        Target Setting Tool (DataPack) Self-Service App

    -   Confirmation that this file has been sent to PAW via the
        Target Setting Tool (DataPack) Self-Service App

    -   In copy: Chair, PPM, assigned DUIT Liaison, and any Interagency
        members that should be aware of ongoing review and discussions.

-   Once this ticket is received, the Target Setting Tool Support Team will confirm
    all the above has occurred and send additional instructions as
    needed

-   The PPM reviews the ticket/email thread and confirms the correct
    individuals have all been copied.

-   The assigned PPM and the assigned DUIT Liaison use both the Target Setting Tool
    Self-Service App and the PAW COP Dossiers to validate and review the
    Target Setting Tool, noting any feedback in the ticket/email thread.

-   The assigned Chair should also review all feedback on the ticket
    thread and any additional comments as needed.

As is possible, all the above should occur within a 24 hour turnaround
from the initial submission of a Target Setting Tool from a Country Team. While
this process will remain the same for each submission for review, the
content of each review will differ, as explained below. Once a Zendesk
ticket and email thread has been started with an initial Target Setting Tool
submission, all future Target Setting Tool submissions related to the same Country
should use the same thread/ticket to allow for easy coordination.

**Submission 1**

-   Validate high-level strategic planning direction aligns with the
    vision set by the PLL.

-   Highlight any areas for technical assistance.

-   Ensure construction of Target Setting Tool has not been tampered with.

For this stage of review, it is not expected that your PSNUxIM tab be
completed or even populated. At this stage, the focus should be on
ensuring the high-level cascade is strategically aligned, and only
afterward proceeding to allocating targets to IMs. Note that this is
also partly to avoid Excel performance issues that may occur with the
addition of more data to the PSNUxIM tab.

**Submission 2**

-   Confirm resolution of any issues flagged during your first
    submission.

-   Confirm no discrepancies between targets modeled in your submitted
    Target Setting Tool and any COP Meeting presentations to date or other
    high-level discussions had with PPMs and Chairs.

-   Review the PSNUxIM tab and address issues related to IM and DSD-TA
    allocation, and deduplication.

**Submission 3**

-   Again confirm Target Setting Tool alignment with all high-level decisions and
    any final presentations given by the Country Team.

-   Confirm resolution of any issues flagged during the second
    submission.

-   Track down and resolve any last bugs and issues in seen in the
    Target Setting Tool

-   Confirm the Target Setting Tool is as near final as possible

**Final Submission**

-   Confirm all targets modeled in the Target Setting Tool are ready for submission
    to DATIM.

-   Secure Interagency Government sign-off for import of your submitted
    Target Setting Tool to DATIM.

-   Note authority to waive any lingering validation issues flagged by
    the Target Setting Tool Self-Service App.

Once approval by PPMs, Chairs, and Liaisons is documented on the Zendesk
thread/ticket, the Target Setting Tool Support Team will move forward with
uploading your submitted Target Setting Tool to DATIM, then note completion of this
here on this ticket. Once this is done, it is recommended that you
review your data in DATIM to ensure alignment between DATIM and your
Target Setting Tool. Please note in addition to these regular formal submissions,
we encourage regular sharing and dialogue with Chair, PPM, and DUIT
Liaison around target setting process generally, and Target Setting Tool
specifically. Feel free to share draft versions as often as is helpful.

## Target Setting Tool SharePoint Location

The Target Setting Tool will be posted on PEPFAR SharePoint:
[www.pepfar.net](http://www.pepfar.net).

**ENTERING DATA IN THE CORRECT SECTION**

In the tabs for the DATIM Data Elements, sections may either have data
prepopulated from DATIM or the user will enter data into that column.
Each section of the guide will list what columns users can expect to
have data prepopulated and / or where they can enter data themselves.

**ENTERING DATA IN THE WRONG SECTION**

If you enter data into a cell that you are not supposed to enter data
into, you will receive the following message box with corrective action
suggestions as well.

**Example:**

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/image9.png")
```

## Adjustments to Historic Targets and Results

Throughout the Target Setting Tool, historic targets and results have been provided
for reference and often to drive target modeling algorithms. If, in the
process of reviewing these historic data, issues with the data are
discovered that may need to be addressed in DATIM, follow the below
procedure:

1.  Raise specific issues with historic data to your PPM and DUIT
    Liaison. Determine together whether any issue identified requires
    updating values in DATIM.

2.  It maybe that together with your PPM and DUIT Liaison you decide
    that changes to historic values are not necessary in DATIM, but
    still necessary in the Target Setting Tool. This is an extraordinary
    circumstance and must have approval from PRIME/DUIT leadership via
    your Liaison to allow. If approved, you may make changes directly in
    the related column of the Target Setting Tool.

3.  If it is the case that DATIM values should be updated, follow the
    usual process for OPU Target changes, requesting all necessary
    approvals to initiate and expedite this process during COP.

4.  Once changes are aprroved, either through an OPU for targets, or
    through data change request for results, you can enter the new
    values into the related column of the Target Setting Tool yourself. If you wish
    to request a new Target Setting Tool, you may do so, but will have to start the
    Target Setting Tool process afresh. For either of these routes, reach out to
    the Target Setting Tool Systems Team via Zendesk for support.

## Target Setting Tool Assumptions

There are many pre-populated assumptions that appear throughout the
Target Setting Tool. These assumptions are included as a result of COP and MER
Guidance. Although Target Setting Tools come pre-populated with these assumptions,
there are various cases and guidance that allow user's to make edits to
these assumptions. Below is a table of all pre-populated assumptions,
the tab in which they are located, the Indicator, the Assumption. 
**Please note that all of these assumptions are all in in editable (Blue) columns** 
in the Target Setting Tool, to align with COP Reform and allow for a reduction
of LOE and need for approvals. Changing these assumptions do not require
approval, and teams are free to change these assumptions as needed.
