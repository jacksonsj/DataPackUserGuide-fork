# SPECTRUM

The Spectrum tab will allow users to load UNAIDS data with 12 columns of data elements for your OU. A Spectrum file for your OU will be provided at the conclusion of the UNAIDS Spectrum Training for Country Teams. The contents of this file will be manually loaded into the Spectrum tab which is setup as below:

```{r echo=FALSE}
schema_table(sheet_name = "Spectrum",
             section = NA,
             columns = col_seq("D", "P"),
             is_html_knit = knitr::is_html_output())
```

With OGAC approval, countries can also populate input their own data into this tab with a different MOH/country approved set of estimates. Estimate changes can also be made in the two associated tabs, Cascade and PMTCT.
