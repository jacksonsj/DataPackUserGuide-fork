The following pages aim to provide users of the Data Pack with the information necessary to successfully complete each tab of the Data Pack tool and determine accurate, data-driven targets. For the past several years, the Data Pack has a been a key element of PEPFAR COP planning, and for COP21 serves a critical function in assisting PEPFAR Country Teams in setting targets in line with the UNAIDS 95-95-95 goals for Testing, Care &amp; Treatment, PMTCT, VMMC, OVC, and other program areas. Please note that the COP21 Data Pack is mandatory and must be used to set targets for COP21. For COP21, all indicators included in the Data Pack are MER 2.5 indicators. For further information on the MER 2.5 indicators, please go to https://datim.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/200929315-MER. 1.1 About the Data Pack The COP21 Data Pack supports analysis for all targets by Priority Subnational Unit (PSNU), population, and Implementing Mechanism (IM). This tool supports calculation of targets based on expected treatment coverage rates by type of PSNU and population prioritization: Attained Scale-up: Aggressive Scale-up: Saturation Sustained Prioritizations for PSNUs are established by the OU based on HIV prevalence and treatment coverage, in addition to other considerations. These determine for a given PSNU programmatically what HIV treatment and prevention services should be planned and informs both the overall strategy and the targets. Teams must review and revise their PSNU prioritization levels for COP21. The COP21 Data Pack assumes a test and start treatment platform and will develop targets for achieving 95% coverage in Scale up: Aggressive and Scale-up: Saturation PSNUs; all other targets in the Data Pack are based on the treatment targets, insofar as the treatment targets are the main focus of reaching epidemic control, and therefore relate to both testing and prevention targets. The Data Pack will allow PEPFAR teams to use country specific programmatic assumptions to develop the optimum targets by PSNU along the program cascades to ensure the necessary number of PLHIV are diagnosed, linked, and start treatment. The Data Pack does not necessarily calculate targets for every indicator, but it has space for teams to enter targets for all indicators and thus can be used to record agreed-upon COP targets, even for non-calculated indicators. Teams must not modify the structure of the COP21 Data Pack in any way. OGAC has developed a process by which targets can be directly imported into DATIM via the Data Pack Site Tool in order to generate targets. However, this is only possible for teams that do not in any way alter the structure or format of the Data Pack. Additional details are provided in COP Guidance and will be available through COP webinars. 1.2 Highlighted Changes from COP20 to COP21 The COP21 Data Pack is largely the same as the COP20 Data Pack. However, please note the following updates that have been implemented as a result of multiple feedback sessions with various country teams that had been identified by the PRIME team. These changes revolve around workflow, ease of target setting, and linkage to the COP guidance based on different aspects of the Data Pack that worked well and others that did not during COP20 target stetting: The EPI Cascade and EPI PMTCT tabs have been merged into the Cascade and PMTCT tabs respectively. Targets will be set at the PSNU level prior to looking into age/sex disaggregates. As in previous years, PSNU-level targets will be distributed across IMs in the PSNUxIM tab. When users first download the Data Pack, this tab will be blank. When the country team is ready to begin this process, they must upload their preliminary Data Pack to the self-service validation app, which will then return a copy of the Data Pack with the PSNUxIM tab populated. 1.3 Data Flow and Review Process to COP21 Submission The results from APR20 have been taken from DATIM and used to populate the Data Pack. In turn, the Data Pack targets will produce FY21 targets that will be subsequently submitted through DATIM after COP21 has been finalized and the PSNU level data entered into the Strategic Direction Summary (SDS) tables, where appropriate (Target related data).

Country Team uses Data Pack Self-Service App to sync data with PAW Dossiers. Country Team saves Data Pack to SharePoint under the OUs HQ Collaboration &gt; COP 2021 - FY 2022 &gt; Guidance, Tools, and Resources folder. Country Team submits a ticket in ZenDesk that includes: A link to the Data Pack file saved in SharePoint Confirmation that this file has been pre-validated in the Data Pack Self-Service App Confirmation that this file has been sent to PAW via the Data Pack Self-Service App In copy: Chair, PPM, assigned DUIT Liaison, and any Interagency members that should be aware of ongoing review and discussions. Once this ticket is received, the Data Pack Support Team will confirm all the above has occurred and send additional instructions as needed The PPM reviews the ticket/email thread and confirms the correct individuals have all been copied. The assigned PPM and the assigned DUIT Liaison use both the Data Pack Self-Service App and the PAW COP Dossiers to validate and review the Data Pack, noting any feedback in the ticket/email thread. The assigned Chair should also review all feedback on the ticket thread and any additional comments as needed. As is possible, all the above should occur within a 24 hour turnaround from the initial submission of a Data Pack from a Country Team. While this process will remain the same for each submission for review, the content of each review will differ, as explained below. Once a Zendesk ticket and email thread has been started with an initial Data Pack submission, all future Data Pack submissions related to the same Country should use the same thread/ticket to allow for easy coordination. Submission 1 Validate high-level strategic planning direction aligns with the vision set by the PLL. Highlight any areas for technical assistance. Ensure construction of Data Pack has not been tampered with. For this stage of review, it is not expected that your PSNUxIM tab be completed or even populated. At this stage, the focus should be on ensuring the high-level cascade is strategically aligned, and only afterward proceeding to allocating targets to IMs. Note that this is also partly to avoid Excel performance issues that may occur with the addition of more data to the PSNUxIM tab. Submission 2 Confirm resolution of any issues flagged during your first submission. Confirm no discrepancies between targets modeled in your submitted Data Pack and any COP Meeting presentations to date or other high-level discussions had with PPMs and Chairs. Review the PSNUxIM tab and address issues related to IM and DSD-TA allocation, and deduplication. Submission 3 Again confirm Data Pack alignment with all high-level decisions and any final presentations given by the Country Team. Confirm resolution of any issues flagged during the second submission. Track down and resolve any last bugs and issues in seen in the Data Pack Confirm the Data Pack is as near final as possible Final Submission Confirm all targets modeled in the Data Pack are ready for submission to DATIM. Secure Interagency Government sign-off for import of your submitted Data Pack to DATIM. Note authority to waive any lingering validation issues flagged by the Data Pack Self-Service App. Once approval by PPMs, Chairs, and Liaisons is documented on the Zendesk thread/ticket, the Data Pack Support Team will move forward with uploading your submitted Data Pack to DATIM, then note completion of this here on this ticket. Once this is done, it is recommended that you review your data in DATIM to ensure alignment between DATIM and your Data Pack. 1.4 Data Pack SharePoint Location The Data Pack will be posted on PEPFAR SharePoint: www.pepfar.net.

Each section of the guide will list what columns users can expect to have data prepopulated and / or where they can enter data themselves. ENTERING DATA IN THE WRONG SECTION If you enter data into a cell that you are not supposed to enter data into, you will receive the following message box with corrective action suggestions as well. Example: 1.9 Adjustments to Historic Targets and Results Throughout the Data Pack, historic targets and results have been provided for reference and often to drive target modeling algorithms. If, in the process of reviewing these historic data, issues with the data are discovered that may need to be addressed in DATIM, follow the below procedure: Raise specific issues with historic data to your PPM and DUIT Liaison. Determine together whether any issue identified requires updating values in DATIM. If it is the case that DATIM values should be updated, follow the usual process for OPU Target changes, requesting all necessary approvals to initiate and expedite this process during COP. Once changes are processed in DATIM, you can either request a new Data Pack with updated data from DATIM, or copy new values into the related column of the Data Pack yourself. For either of these routes, reach out to the Data Pack Systems Team via Zendesk for support. It may also be the case that together with your PPM and DUIT Liaison you decide that changes to historic values are not necessary in DATIM, but still necessary in the Data Pack. This is an extraordinary circumstance and must have approval from DUIT Liaisons to allow. If approved, you may make changes directly in the related column of the Data Pack.

HTS Tab Formula Error In the HTS Tab there is an error within the formula that helps calculate TB_STAT: New Positive (%) in column Z of the HTS_TST - Distribution of Positive Tests section. This formula is currently referencing HTS_TST Post ANC1 New Positives (FY22) from column J, but needs to be referencing TB_STAT New Positives (FY22) from column K. To make this simple change, please adjust the formula from \\[=IF(OR(SUM(\\$G15)=0,SUM(\\$J15)=0),&quot;&quot;,SUM(\\$J15)/SUM(\\$G15))\\] and change the reference of column J to column K so that it reads \\[=IF(OR(SUM(\\$G15)=0,SUM(\\$K15)=0),&quot;&quot;,SUM(\\$K15)/SUM(\\$G15))\\] PSNUxIM Tab Formulas When you received your newly generated PSNUxIM tab for the first time, you will need to scroll to the Target Values Section that begins in column CW and copy down the formulas populated in row 15 all the way down to the bottom of your Data Pack. This will be required in order for your Rollup column to properly populate as well as the Deduplication sections. "],["04-Frequently-Asked-Questions.html", "4 Frequently Asked Questions", " 4 Frequently Asked Questions Q: When working through PSNUxIM KP mechanism allocations and I allocate the KP-specific targets to KP partners, given that the KP disags are a subset of the total population being targeted, do I also need to allocate total pop targets to the KP partner? A: Yes, you should be setting a corresponding Total Pop target against each mechanism you set KeyPop targets against. This is because KeyPop is a subset of Total Pop. Q: Can you use FY22 Spectrum estimates to work through the Cascade tab? A: No, unless you receive approval from OGAC Leadership you should use FY21 Spectrum Data. Your target setting process for the COP21 Data Pack should be to set FY22 targets based on where you are ending FY21. Q: Is the coverage rate that is used to calculate Targeted Host Country TX_CURR_SUBNAT (FY22) and Targeted Host Country TX_NET_NEW_SUBNAT (FY22) too high or being miscalculated? A: No, this is not a formula error. The calculations occurring are focusing on PLHIV for each district that are being treated for HIV/AIDS for each age band, as opposed to those being treated for HIV/AIDS in the district regardless of whether they live in that district. if the PEPFAR results are higher than the PLHIV Spectrum estimate in a particular district, then back-calculating the coverage rate shows a greater than 100% value for that PSNU-Age-Sex band. This can come from one of two things generally: People are coming from outside the district to seek treatment, leading to a higher PEPFAR TX_CURR value than PLHIV in the district; or The PLHIV estimate from Spectrum is too low. Either way if you have good programmatic reason for doing so, particularly health seeking behavior of PLHIV, you can aim for a coverage rate even higher than 100% (e.g., current coverage in capital city is estimated at 105%, but due to health seeking behavior you want to aim for 120% to achieve 95% for across all metropolitan area). Q: Why in the newly generated PSNUxIM tab are data-pack totals and roll up columns blank? A: Once you have regenerated your PSNUxIM tab from the Data Pack Self-Service app, please open your newly regenerated tool, save your tool and close it. When you reopen your tool, it should populate your targets into that column. You will also need to drag down the formula in the far right Target Values section of the PSNUxIM tab to ensure all rows are populated with the proper formula. Q: If my program performs testing but not treatment, how do I represent this in the Data Pack? A: You will first need approval from OGAC Leadership to do this. If you receive this approval you will need to manually alter in the Cascade Tab column HTS_TST_POS + PMTCT_HEI_POS (FY22) (BD). Please make the alterations to this column and not on the HTS tab. Q: When I try to validate my Data Pack in the self-service app, I get a message saying ERROR: An error has occurred. Check your logs or contact the app author for clarification. How do I resolve this? A: This error can be caused by a number of different issues. The most common causes and their resolutions include: Trying to validate a newly regenerated Data Pack before opening it and saving it. After generating or regenerating your PSNUxIM tab, it is necessary to first open your tool and save it before uploading it to the app. The browser is causing issues with the app. This can be resolved by opening an Incognito window or by clearing your cache. PLEASE NOTE: Clearing your cache will sign you out of all accounts in that browser. Trying to validate a file that isnt an XLSX. If your team has saved your Data Pack in a different file format for sharing, such as XLSB, ensure that you resave the file as an XLSX before validating it in the app. The target distribution formulas on the PSNUxIM tab have not been applied to all rows. By default, the formulas in the Target Value section (Column CW and right) are only applied to Row 15. Once you generate or regenerate your PSNUxIM tab, ensure that you copy these formulas all the way down to the bottom row of your targets. After this is done, try validating your tool again. If none of the above issues apply to your Data Pack tool and you are still receiving this error, please submit a ZenDesk ticket identifying your country and attaching or linking to a copy of the Data Pack tool that caused the error in the app. "],["05-How-To-Use-The-User-Manual.html", "5 How to Use the User Manual 5.1 Key Column Highlights", " 5 How to Use the User Manual The Data Pack consists of tabs that address indicators related to each PEPFAR program area.

This tab, new to the COP21 Data Pack, is a consolidation of some elements of the TX and HTS tabs present in previous Data Pack versions, and begins with an analysis of gap to ART coverage disaggregated by geography and population, then uses this analysis to progress through modeling of first treatment, then viral load suppression, and finally testing targets. This tab also links heavily with many other tabs of the Data Pack, including the PMTCT, TB, EID, VMMC, HTS, CXCA, HTS_RECENT, TX_TB_PREV, and KP tabs. By beginning with the Cascade tab, moving through each of these other tabs, and continually returning to the Cascade tab to monitor and iteratively adjust the overall program plan, Country Teams can both retain a cohesive and intentional strategy across program area, geography, and population, as well as anchor this strategy in data and the realities of past performance. 10.1 Host Country Context F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S Column Name Host Country Est.

Host Country Estimated PLHIV (FY21) [PLHIV.T_1]: Estimated number of people living with HIV, projected as of September 2021.

Host Country Estimated Virally Suppressed ART Patients [VL_SUPPRESSION_SUBNAT.T_1]: Estimated PLHIV on ART and virally suppressed, projected as of September 2021. 10.1.1 DATIM Import As part of the Data Pack approval process, all of the above FY21 projected estimates will be uploaded into DATIM and replace any preexisting estimates for these indicators that may have already been entered in DATIM, perhaps via Data Pack upload during COP20. 10.1.2 Instructions If using UNAIDS Spectrum as the source for these data: Review the above columns to confirm that data has been correctly linked with the Spectrum tab. You may consider using filter drop-down menus to quickly inspect for any non-numeric, negative, or invalid data. Review Relative Standard Error values to identify any estimates with a Relative Standard Error of more than or equal to 20. See the section below for additional instructions. If not using UNAIDS Spectrum as the source for these data, see the below section. Confirm that no data has been entered against Military Organization Units. See below for more explanation. 10.1.3 Leveraging Alternatives to Spectrum In general, all data for the above should use UNAIDS Spectrum as their source. However, there may be cases where either a more up to date or reliable source exists, or where data may not be fully available from UNAIDS Spectrum. In these cases, Country Teams may request approval from their PPM and a DUIT Liaison to use an alternative data source. Be sure to request and document this approval before deciding not to use Spectrum as the source for your Data Pack host country estimates, as well as what source is approved for use in its place. This is true for all cases where you may need to leverage an alternative to Spectrum, whether for an entire indicator, or for a specific geography or population. For those not leveraging Spectrum to provide host country context estimates, you may paste estimates from other approved sources into this section of the Cascade tab by overwriting the formulas currently in these columns. Due to hidden Relative Standard Error columns between the various estimate columns, it is recommended you paste this data in one column at a time, rather than in bulk. It may also reduce technical issues to first copy geographic data in the SNU1, PSNU, Age, and Sex columns into a separate spreadsheet, then use Excel lookup functions to add estimates data against the correct geographies and populations, and then return to pasting data into the original Cascade tab column by column. 10.1.4 Relative Standard Errors Data exported from UNAIDS Spectrum will also come with a series Relative Standard Errors for each data point, both at the District level as well as the Age/Sex-specific level. Along with the data points listed above, Relative Standard Errors for each will also automatically be populated in the Cascade tab from data loaded into the Spectrum tab. While initially, these Error columns will be hidden, you may inspect these values by unhiding these columns. Based on these Relative Standard Errors, data points in related columns will be color-coded to indicate the relative uncertainty of each specific data point along the following ranges: Red: Relative Standard Error of 40 or greater. Yellow: Relative Standard Error of less than 40, but more than or equal to 20. Green: Relative Standard Error of less than 20. While these error estimates are available as a reference as teams formulate targets, red or yellow highlighting may not always mean a data point should be thrown out, nor is it the case that all green values should be taken at face value. Either way, consider these error estimates as helpful guideposts in interpreting the contextual meaning and data quality of data provided via UNAIDS Spectrum output. If, in reviewing Relative Standard Error values, the uncertainty interval of an estimate appears to be concerning, consider the following next steps: Raise and discuss the issue with your PPM and DUIT Liaison. Communicate concerns to assigned UNAIDS liaisons and discuss appropriate methods for improving or better understanding data quality for the data points in question. 10.1.5 Host Country Estimates for Military Organization Units Due to issues of political sensitivity and national security, estimates for the above indicators should not be entered against Military Organization Units. Any case where this does occur will be flagged in the Data Pack Self-Service App, and removed during DATIM import. 10.2 Cascade: TX_NET_NEW_SUBAT T U V W X Y Z AA AB Column Name PEPFAR TX_CURR (FY20 Results) PEPFAR TX_CURR (FY21 Targets) PEPFAR TX_NET_NEW (FY21 Targets) PEPFAR Coverage of Host Country TX_CURR_SUBNAT (FY21) (%) PEPFAR Coverage of Host Country TX_NET_NEW_SUBNAT (FY22) (%) Host Country Est.

See below for additional information. 10.2.3 PEPFAR Coverage of Host Country TX_NET_NEW_SUBNAT In the next section of the Data Pack, the TX_NET_NEW_SUBNAT determined in this section will be used to estimate necessary PEPFAR TX_NET_NEW. To estimate PEPFARs contribution to total TX_NET_NEW_SUBNAT in the country, the Data Pack compares PEPFARs most recent APR results for TX_CURR against the observed host country TX_CURR_SUBNAT results  sourced from UNAIDS Spectrum, or an alternative approved source, as described in the Host Country Context section prior to this  for the same time period. While the behavior of PEPFAR and Host Country TX_CURR may differ from that of TX_NET_NEW, this gives a baseline from which to begin, and ultimately you may adjust this baseline in the green column titled PEPFAR Coverage of Host Country TX_NET_NEW_SUBNAT (FY22) (%) to more accurately reflect the likely reality of PEPFARs contribution to TX_NET_NEW_SUBNAT. 10.2.4 Targeted Host Country ART Coverage One of the most pivotal data points in the Data Pack is the baseline estimate of Host Country ART Coverage. To calculate the estimated Host Country ART Coverage for FY21 (i.e., projected as of September 2021), the Data Pack uses the following formula: In the case that PEPFARs reported TX_CURR results for FY20 exceed the reported Host Country Observed TX_CURR_SUBNAT for FY20, the following function will be used to calculate ART Coverage instead of the above: Reviewing and understanding the ART Coverage estimate arrived at in this column is critical for much of the rest of the Data Pack. In particular, this column is later instrumental in determining the following key data points: Host Country TX_CURR_SUBNAT Host Country TX_NET_NEW_SUBNAT PEPFAR TX_CURR PEPFAR TX_NEW PEPFAR TX_PVLS PEPFAR HTS_TST totals PEPFAR HTS_INDEX After reviewing data in this column, examine the next column, Targeted Host Country ART Coverage (FY22) (%). In line with the UNAIDS 95-95-95 goals, this column defaults to 90%, reflecting that since the denominator in the Data Pack calculation is Host Country Estimated PLHIV instead of only those PLHIV who know their HIV Status, this column should be the equivalent of: However, in cases where baseline ART Coverage may be greater than 90%, baseline ART Coverage will be used instead of 90%. No matter the starting default for Targeted Host Country ART Coverage, you may adjust this target to fit the realities of your country context, and the strategy of your treatment program. It may also be helpful to return to this column to iteratively adjust it as you proceed through the next few sections of the Data Pack. NOTE: The Data Pack will not prevent situations resulting in ART coverage exceeding 100% in a given PSNU, but will flag these cases in yellow to highlight when it occurs. Given that these may be a common occurrence in cases of urban PSNUs, they are allowable in the Data Pack, though should be coordinated with PPMs and DUIT Liaisons. 10.2.5 Targeted TX_CURR_SUBNAT and TX_NET_NEW_SUBNAT Targeted Host Country TX_CURR_SUBNAT (FY22) is set as follows (rounded to the nearest integer): Based on this target, Targeted Host Country TX_NET_NEW_SUBNAT (FY22) is set as follows: In performing this calculation, the Data Pack also compares projected FY21 Host Country TX_CURR_SUBNAT values reported in the Data Pack against FY21 PEPFAR TX_CURR targets as contained in DATIM. If PEPFAR targets exceed Host Country projected TX_CURR_SUBNAT values for FY21, Targeted Host Country TX_NET_NEW_SUBNAT for FY22 is instead calculated as follows: For those using Spectrum as their source for TX_CURR_SUBNAT projections, this scenario is rare because of incorporation of PEPFAR TX_CURR targets into Spectrum modeling. However, it may be possible to see discrepancies between PEPFAR TX_CURR targets and modeled TX_CURR_SUBNAT values, especially as Country Teams continue to make necessary OPU target changes. In this case, as well as in cases where data from alternative sources may exhibit discrepancies, the Data Pack takes this into account and adjusts to maintain reasonable Host Country TX_NET_NEW_SUBNAT targets as best as possible. 10.2.6 Gap to Coverage Analysis for Military Organization Units Due to sensitivities around ART coverage estimates for Military organization units and populations, this data will not be reflected here in the Data Pack. Country Teams should coordinate closely with Department of Defense liaisons who will perform a similar analysis based on available data sources and then directly paste resulting TX_CURR targets into the Data Pack against the _Military organization unit, overwriting the formulas present in the TX_CURR column described in the next section. 10.3 Cascade: TX_CURR TX_CURR: Number of adults and children currently receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART).

Adjust assumptions in previous sections as necessary. (See below for additional information about TX_NET_NEW_SUBNAT targeting.) Review FY22 TX_CURR targets to identify and resolve any issues pertaining to previous modeling assumptions or decisions. (See below for additional information about TX_CURR targeting.) For infant populations: Continue moving on through the remainder of the Cascade tab, taking special care to review the PMTCT and EID tabs of the Data Pack, reconciling issues with overall Testing Rationalization along the way. Once modeling of PMTCT, EID, and HEI_POS targets is complete, return to this section of the Data Pack to review how HEI_POS targets on the EID tab link to TX_CURR on the Cascade tab. See below for additional information. 10.3.3 TX_NET_NEW (FY22) For those one year old and older, TX_NET_NEW targets for FY22 are set in the Data Pack as follows, rounded to the nearest integer: For a description of how TX_NET_NEW is modeled for infants, see section below. 10.3.4 TX_CURR (FY22) For those one year old and older, TX_CURR targets for FY22 are set in the Data Pack as follows: For a description of how TX_CURR is modeled for infants, see section below. 10.3.5 Setting TX_CURR Targets among Infant Population Groups Because infants enter the Treatment cohort through a distinctly separate method than the rest of the population, and also given that all infants in the previous years Treatment cohort will entirely shift into the 1-4 year old age group leaving none to carry over into the next years cohort, TX_CURR targets for this population do not follow the chain of logic described thus far. Instead, TX_CURR targets for infants are driven by the model for EID testing, which is in turn based on the model for PMTCT testing and treatment. As described above in the Instructions section for this tab, upon confirming targets set in the PMTCT and EID tabs, return to the PMTCT_HEI_POS Linked to ART (FY22) column in this section to review ART targets for infants. Because HEI_POS targets are set without disaggregation by sex, these are allocated equally to male and female infants in the Cascade tab. Because all infants in the previous years Treatment cohort will entirely shift into the 1-4 year old age group, both TX_NET_NEW and TX_CURR for infants will reflect 100% of the value in the PMTCT_HEI_POS Linked to ART (FY22) column. 10.4 Cascade: TX_NEW TX_NEW: Number of adults and children newly enrolled on antiretroviral therapy (ART).

This is defaulted to 100%, but can be adjusted as necessary. See below for additional instructions. Review targeted Retention Rates for those New on ART and those Already on ART for FY22. These are both defaulted at 98%, but can be adjusted as necessary. Red highlighting will identify cases where these may be set above 100%, and yellow highlighting those cases were set below 98%. Review historic data for TX_NEW Results and Targets for reference. Review FY22 TX_NEW targets and return to previous sections to adjust assumptions and modeling decisions as necessary. See below for additional information. 10.4.3 Proportion of TX_NET_NEW from New ART Initiation New to the COP21 Data Pack, this column allows for several scenarios that may impact how PEPFAR TX_NET_NEW translates to TX_NEW targets. The most common of these scenarios include: Cases where TX_RTT may contribute in part to TX_NET_NEW, requiring a reduction in how much TX_NET_NEW is converted into targets for TX_NEW. While TX_RTT targets are not set in the COP21 Data Pack, this column does allow for the possibility that some amount of TX_RTT may be an unavoidable part of a cohesive, effective treatment strategy. Cases where PEPFAR may be absorbing or beginning support for an existing Treatment cohort from a non-PEPFAR partner, such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Red highlighting will identify cases where this column is set above 100%, and yellow highlighting where it is set below 100% for review purposes. As described below, any adjustments to this column will directly impact the target set for TX_NEW. As such, be sure to receive approval from your PPM and DUIT Liaison for any changes to this column, and be prepared to explain and justify the rationale for these changes as necessary. It is important to note that even in cases where TX_NET_NEW may be zero, it still may be necessary to add individuals into the Treatment cohort, whether from new initiation or otherwise, to compensate for those individuals lost to follow up. In these scenarios, the proportion described in this section will apply to this non-zero total of individuals to be added to the Treatment cohort. In other words, the Proportion of TX_NET_NEW from New ART Initiation can be described as: As explained above, the number of individuals to be added to the Treatment Cohort may not be the same as TX_NET_NEW in all cases due to Retention Rates among the prior year Treatment Cohort. In other words, and given that therefore, All this means that the Proportion of TX_NET_NEW from New ART can be framed as follows: See below to see how this affects TX_NEW targeting. 10.4.4 TX_NEW (FY22) For those one year old and older, PEPFAR TX_NEW targets for FY22 will be set using the formula laid out above for Proportion of TX_NET_NEW from New ART, solving for TX_NEW, with each component and the total rounded to the nearest integer: See below for additional information about how TX_NEW targets are set among Infant populations. 10.4.5 Setting TX_NEW Targets among Infant Populations Based upon rationales explained in previous sections above, TX_NEW targets for infant populations will simply reflect TX_NET_NEW values determined in the TX_CURR section of the Cascade tab. Refer to that section for more information about how to adjust TX_NEW targets for infant populations. 10.5 Cascade: TX_PVLS (D) TX_PVLS (D): Number of ART patients with a Viral Load (VL) result documented in the medical or laboratory records/laboratory information system (LIS) within the past 12 months.

The default assumption is 70%, reflecting the MER 2.5 guidance that individuals must have been on ART for at least 3 months in order to be eligible for viral load testing. Red highlighting in this column indicates values over 100%, and yellow highlighting values below 70%. Review and adjust assumptions describing access to viral load testing among those eligible. The default assumption is 100%, reflecting the goal that viral load testing should be available to all those receiving ART.

See below for additional information. 10.5.3 TX_PVLS (D): Routine (FY22) While MER 2.5 allows for both Routine and Targeted Viral Load testing, only Routine Viral Load testing will be targeted as part of COP 21 planning. Within the Data Pack, TX_PVLS Denominator targets for Routine Viral Load Testing are set as follows, rounded to the nearest integer: Note that no retention rates are applied against either TX_NEWt nor TX_CURRt-1 , reflecting the goal that all individuals on ART should be tested for viral load suppression, no matter whether they may in the future  even within the same Fiscal Year  be lost to follow-up. 10.6 Cascade: TX_PVLS (N) TX_PVLS (N): Number of ART patients with suppressed VL results (&lt;1,000 copies/mL) documented in the medical or laboratory results/LIS within the past 12 months.

Review the Percent of HTS_TST_POS from HTS_INDEX from FY20 results, based on data reported in DATIM, for historical context. Review and adjust Targeted % of HTS_TST_POS from HTS_INDEX for FY22. These are set based on FY21 ART Coverage, per COP 21 Guidance, but can be altered as needed. Red highlights indicate percentages above 100%; yellow highlights indicate percentages below thresholds stipulated in COP 21 Guidance. See below for additional information. Review total testing targets (HTS_TST_POS + PMTCT_HEI_POS) for FY22. Where necessary, return to previous assumptions and adjust appropriately. Review total Index testing targets (HTS_INDEX) for FY22 and adjust the Targeted % of HTS_TST_POS from HTX_INDEX for FY22 as necessary. Review FY22 targets for PMTCT_STAT New Positives and HTS_TST Post ANC1 New Positives and navigate to the PMTCT tab to adjust underlying assumptions as necessary. Review FY22 targets for TB_STAT New Positives and navigate to the TB tab to adjust underlying assumptions as necessary. Review FY22 targets for VMMC_CIRC Tested Positives and navigate to the VMMC tab to adjust underlying assumptions as necessary. Review FY22 targets for PMTCT_HEI_POS and navigate to the EID tab to adjust underlying assumptions as necessary. For infants under 1 year old, 100% of testing targets should come through PMTCT_HEI_POS. See below for additional information. Review FY22 targets for HTS_TST_POS from All Other Modalities and navigate to the HTS tab to adjust underlying assumptions as necessary. Review percentage contributions toward FY22 targeted Total Positives from HTS_INDEX, PMTCT ANC1, PMTCT Post ANC1, TB_STAT, VMMC, PMTCT_HEI_POS, and All Other Modalities. Red highlights across these columns indicate cases where targets have been over- or under-distributed across modalities. See below for additional information about reconciling discrepancies among these modalities. 10.7.3 Targeted % of HTS_TST_POS from HTS_INDEX Per COP 21 Guidance, the total number of positives targeted to be identified through Index Testing is initially modeled based on FY21 ART Coverage as follows: ART Coverage &lt; 70%: 30% of total positives to be identified through Index Testing ART Coverage &gt;= 70% &amp; &lt;80%: 50% of total positives to be identified through Index Testing ART Coverage &gt;= 80%: 75% of total positives to be identified through Index Testing In cases where historic FY20 results showed Index Testing contributing to more than this share of testing, the larger value will be used. Again, while modeled per the above, this value can adjusted as needed. 10.7.4 Testing Rationalization As testing targets are set in the PMTCT, TB, VMMC, and EID tabs, these will be reflected here on the Cascade tab to reconcile against those high-level testing targets set following the logic flow set forth in preceding sections. This section of the Cascade tab can serve as a sort of Table of Contents to help you navigate across these various tabs as you adjust assumptions and reconcile targets. Similar Testing Rationalization sections exist in each of these separate tabs for easier reference. Red highlighting will indicate any case where over- or under-distribution of testing targets across testing modalities has occurred, keying primarily from the Total Positives from All Other Modalities (FY22) (%) column. As these issues arise, determine whether these issues require adjustment of either preceding Treatment and total Testing targets, or related targets in the PMTCT, TB, VMMC, or EID tabs. After testing targets have been allocated to PMTCT ANC1, PMTCT Post ANC1, TB_STAT, VMMC_CIRC, and PMTCT_HEI_POS, any remainder will be available for further allocation against all remaining testing modalities in the HTS tab of the Data Pack. 10.7.5 Testing Targets for Infant Populations Similar to targets for HIV-positive infants linked to ART as explained above, targets for infants identified as HIV-positive are initially set in the EID tab, without sex disaggregation. In reflecting these in the Cascade tab, these values are equally allocated across male and female infants. Per COP 21 Guidance, 100% of these testing targets for infant populations should be accommodated for via PMTCT_HEI_POS, and no other modality. Should any portion of these targets be allocated to any other modality, an alert will be flagged in the Data Pack Self-Service App. Conditional formatting within the Data Pack will also indicate when this has occurred. 10.8 Cascade: DIAGNOSED_SUBNAT BQ BR Column Name Total Positives from PMTCT_HEI_POS (FY22) (%) Total Positives from All Other Modalities (FY22) (%) UID HTS_TST.HEI_POS.Share.T HTS_TST.Total_Other.Pos.Share.T Column Type? reference reference What type of data? percentage percentage Prepopulated data?

Review and adjust the Expected change in new ANC clients, which should help indicate whether there is an anticipated change in the number of women presenting to ANC compared to FY21. This is defaulted at 0%, though this reflects no suggestion of strategy from S/GAC. Adjust these growth rates to reflect intentional, data-driven, strategic programming. Values can be negative or positive percentages in this column, which will decrease or increase the FY22 target for PMTCT_STAT (D) respectively. (If the expected number of women presenting in ANC for FY21 is the same as FY20, the value in column F would be 0%. If it increased by 50%, the value would be 50%. If the number should decrease by 20%, enter -20%.)

Review FY22 projections for (a) Estimated % ANC1 clients with already Known HIV Positive status, and (b) Estimated Positivity Rate among Newly Tested ANC1 clients. These data default to remain static from related FY21 rates added to the Host Country Context section of this tab. Where these are unavailable, these instead use FY20 results trends. In either case, these can be adjusted as necessary with approval by your PPM and DUIT Liaison. Red highlights indicate percentages over 100%; yellow highlights indicate percentages different from FY20 results. See below for additional information. Review Total PMTCT_STAT (N), which will display the numerator value for PMTCT_STAT based on the multiplication of PMTCT_STAT (D) and the Targeted testing coverage of ANC1 clients (FY22). To make changes to the PMTCT numerator, adjust either the PMTCT denominator or the desired testing coverage. Review PMTCT_STAT Known HIV Status, Positive, which will be calculated based on multiplying Total PMTCT_STAT (N) by the Estimated percent of ANC1 clients already Known HIV Positive. Review PMTCT_STAT Newly Tested, Positive, which will be calculated based on first removing the PMTCT_STAT Known HIV Status, Positive cohort from Total PMTCT_STAT (N), then by multiplying this value by the Estimated Positivity Rate among Newly Tested ANC1 clients.

This column serves as the starting point of the EID modeling process on the EID tab. For more information about the role of this data relative to EID targets, see that section of this User Guide. Use the remainder of this section of the PMTCT tab to analyze how PMTCT_STAT Newly Tested, Positives fit within the context of an overall testing strategy. In particular, consider how this modality contributes to total HTS_TST_POS in relation to HTS_INDEX, TB_STAT, and all other HTS modalities. Review any cases where this section is highlighted red, indicating over- or under-allocation of HTS_TST_POS targets across contributing modalities. While these allocation issues may be more the result of a different modality(ies), analysis of these to confirm no adjustments to PMTCT_STAT are warranted may prevent issues and additional work in other sections of the Data Pack. Return to other tabs of the Data Pack where issues flagged in this section require adjustment of either total HTS_TST_POS targets, or targets via other modalities.

Review FY20 results for Observed Indeterminate/Not Tested Rate and Observed Positivity Rate among those VMMC clients newly tested for HIV, both of which are obtained from DATIM. Review and adjust FY22 projections for Estimated Indeterminate/Not Tested Rate and Estimated Positivity Rate among VMMC clients newly tested for HIV. Both of these estimates are initially set equal to their counterpart set in step 5, but can be adjusted as needed. Red highlights in either indicate percentages above 100% or below 0%; yellow highlights in the Estimated Positivity Rate column indicate yields greater than 1%. Review Targeted ART Linkage Rate for linkage between VMMC_CIRC: HIV Positive and TX_NEW. This rate is locked in step with ART Linkage Rates set on the Cascade Tab, which default to 95%; return to that tab to adjust this rate, though note that this will alter linkage rates across all modalities. Review modeled targets for Total VMMC_CIRC. See below for more information. Return to steps 1-4 and the previous section for VMMC_CIRC_SUBNAT to adjust assumptions driving this target. Review modeled targets for VMMC_CIRC Indeterminate/Note Tested, HIV Positive, and HIV Negative. See below for additional information about each of these. Finally, review modeled data for those identified HIV positive via VMMC projected to be linked to ART, which is set by multiplying those identified HIV positive by the ART linkage rate reviewed in step 7. 14.2.3 Total VMMC_CIRC (FY22) For Military organization units, FY22 targets for Total VMMC_CIRC is set as follows, rounding to the nearest integer: For all other organization units, FY22 targets for Total VMMC_CIRC are set as follows, rounding to the nearest integer: 14.2.4 VMMC_CIRC Disaggregates (FY22) In disaggregating total VMMC_CIRC for FY22 Targets, the Data Pack will first set targets for those projected to have indeterminate HIV testing results or to deny testing, then targets for those identified positive, and finally those negative. To set targets for Indeterminate/Not Tested, the Data Pack will use the following formula, rounding to the nearest integer: For VMMC_CIRC HIV Positive, the Data Pack will set targets as follows, rounding to the nearest integer: And finally, VMMC_CIRC HIV Negative targets will be set as a remainder function, as follows: 14.3 VMMC: Testing Rationalization AF AG AH AI AJ Column Name Total HTS_TST_POS (FY22) Total Positives from VMMC_CIRC (FY22) (%) Total Positives from HTS_INDEX (FY22) (%) Total Positives from TB_STAT (FY22) (%) Total Positives from All Other Modalities (FY22) (%) UID HTS_TST.Pos.T HTS_TST.VMMC.Pos.Share.T HTS_TST.Index.Pos.Share.T HTS_TST.TB.Pos.Share.T HTS_TST.Total_Other.Pos.Share.T Column Type? reference reference reference reference reference What type of data? integer percentage percentage percentage percentage Prepopulated data?

In particular, consider how this modality contributes to total HTS_TST_POS in relation to HTS_INDEX, TB_STAT, and all other HTS modalities. Review any cases where this section is highlighted red, indicating over- or under-allocation of HTS_TST_POS targets across contributing modalities. While these allocation issues may be more the result of a different modality(ies), analysis of these to confirm no adjustments to VMMC_CIRC are warranted may prevent issues and additional work in other sections of the Data Pack. Return to other tabs of the Data Pack where issues flagged in this section require adjustment of either total HTS_TST_POS targets, or targets via other modalities.

The positivity yield should be between 15 and 40% among adults and there are further requirements for the SGAC accepted proportion of positives coming from the index testing modality. Users should reference the COP 2020 Guidance document for the required parameters based on TX coverage. Review data for what percent of HTS_TST_POS comes from modalities set in other sections or tabs of the Data Pack. Note that to adjust these allocations, you must return to the section or tab of the Data Pack where these are initially set. Hyperlinks in column headers can help you navigate to the exact column where this occurs. DO NOT adjust allocation percentages for these gray columns in this section of the HTS tab as this will NOT affect any final targets and will break linkages between this tab and source data. These modalities to be reviewed, but adjusted elsewhere include: HTS_INDEX_COM_POS (FY22) HTS_INDEX_FAC_POS (FY22) PMTCT_STAT: New Positives (FY22) HTS_TST PMTCT Post ANC1: Positives (FY22) TB_STAT: New Positives (FY22) VMMC_CIRC: HIV Positive (FY22) Review and adjust planned percentage contributions to HTS_TST_POS from all other HTS modalities, which will initially be populated based on trends seen in FY20 results, but can be adjusted as needed to align with COP21 testing strategies. Note that as you adjust these allocation percentages, the number of projected individuals to be identified HIV positive will change in the corresponding modality block to the right. These modalities to be adjusted in this section include: Facility  Inpatient (FY22) Facility  Pediatric (FY22) Facility  Malnutrition (FY22) Facility  STI Clinic (FY22) Facility  Emergency (FY22) Facility  Other PITC (FY22) Facility  VCT (FY22) Community  Mobile (FY22) Community - Other (FY22) Use the Distribution Check column to confirm that distributions of HTS_TST_POS across all HTS modalities do not result in over- or under-allocation. Where this check column is either greater than or less than 100%, red highlights will appear across all modalities, indicating the need to adjust percentage allocations.

Review targets for the number of individuals to be tested and found HIV Positive through each modality, using hyperlinks in column headers to return to the Distribution of Positive Tests section of this tab to adjust allocation rates as needed. Note that these are rounded to the nearest integer. See the following section for instructions as to how to identify and resolve rounding errors that may compound across modalities as a result. Review targets for the number of individuals to be tested and found HIV Negative through each modality, which are based on the combination of allocations set in the Distribution of Positive Tests section of this tab, and yield rates set in step 1. Note that these are rounded to the nearest integer. See the following section for instructions as to how to identify and resolve rounding errors that may compound across modalities as a result. In cases where yields are 0%, but Negative test results are targeted, you may manually enter these in this step, though note that this will prevent further dynamic modeling of targets should Positive test result targets be needed in the future. Please also mind conditional formatting guiding entry of these targets against correct ages, which may differ across modality, particularly for Pediatric and Malnutrition modalities. 15.5 HTS: HTS_TST (Total) These calculated columns provide a roll up sum of the total targets set by age, sex and modality in the rest of the HTS tab.

See below for additional, detailed instructions. Any cell that is highlighted indicates that it is in a row that users should review the distribution of positives. Review FY22 Targets for individuals to be tested and found HIV negative through PMTCT_STAT, HTS_TST Post ANC1, TB_STAT, and VMMC_CIRC. To adjust these values, follow hyperlinks to the source of data for these columns. Review modeled targets for Total HTS_TST_NEG, Total HTS_TST, and the Aggregate Yield Rate, which is modeled simply by dividing the final HTS_TST_POS total by the total HTS_TST target. 15.5.3 Resolve HTS_TST_POS Rounding Differences In the process of allocating HTS_TST_POS targets across HTS modalities, the multiplication of integer values representing whole people by percentage allocations, followed by rough rounding, often causes slight rounding errors to accumulate across ages, sexes, and geographies. In situations where there may be significantly small HTS_TST_POS targets being spread over multiple HTS modalities, the aggregation of many small rounding errors can lead to large differences in planned and final HTS_TST_POS. This section of the Data Pack is built to help identify and resolve these cases, where they occur. Prior to using this section, it is key that all allocations be complete, either in those modalities called out specifically in the Cascade tab, or in the HTS tabs Distribution of Positive Tests section. With this complete, only true rounding error cases will remain to be identified in this section of the Data Pack. Cases where rounding errors may have occurred will be highlighted in red formatting in the column titled, HTS_TST_POS difference to adjust; Excel filters may be helpful in narrowing to these rows. By first reviewing and refining allocations in the Cascade tab of the Data Pack for overall HTS_INDEX, PMTCT_STAT, HTS_TST PMTCT Post ANC1, TB_STAT, and VMMC_CIRC, any rounding errors still present on the HTS tab are more likely the result of distributions decided on this tab across the following modalities: Inpatient (Facility) Pediatric (Facility) Malnutrition (Facility) TB_STAT (Facility) PMTCT_STAT (Facility) PMTCT Post ANC1 (Facility) VMMC (Facility) STI Clinic (Facility) Emergency (Facility) Other PITC (Facility) VCT (Facility) Mobile (Community) Other (Community) The process for resolving rounding errors across these modalities may involve some trial and error. In all cases, but especially for cases where total HTS_TST_POS is small and rounding errors could represent large swings in total targets, it is necessary to determine which modality(ies) should be allocated remainder HTS_TST_POS identified in this section. Iteratively return to the HTS_TST Distribution of Positive Tests section on this HTS tab to adjust allocations, then return to this section to check for lingering rounding remainders. At the culmination of this iterative approach, there should be no values or highlighting remaining in the HTS_TST_POS difference to adjust column of this section. 15.6 HTS: HTS_SELF HTS_SELF (N): Number of individual HIV self-test kits distributed.

To add or remove any SNUs on this list during the COP21 process, notify your assigned PPM, as well as DREAMS liaisons on the PEPFAR Program Quality Team to ensure these changes are reflected in your Data Pack. After communicating and documenting these updates centrally, the Data Pack Self-Service App will alert to an update in the DREAMS SNU list and provide an updated Data Pack with updated data in this DREAMS SNU? column. Note that in the interim, you may manually overwrite or alter flags in this column, though any discrepancies between this column in the Data Pack and the centrally-maintained list of DREAMS SNUs will be flagged in the Data Pack Self-Service App and must be resolved prior to COP Approval and DATIM import. Review columns FY20 Results and FY21 Targets which will come pre-populated with results and targets from DATIM and will serve as a baseline for COP21 target calculations. Review the column Projected Net Change in OVC_SERV (%), which will be preset with a default rate of 0%. Alter this percent value to either increase or decrease the OVC targets for COP21. Changes in this column will affect the overall OVC_SERV targets reflected in column Total OVC_SERV. Review and adjust the allocation of total OVC_SERV across DREAMS, Preventive, and Comprehensive: For DREAMS, allocations are only allowable where a district is denoted as a DREAMS SNU  to adjust, return to step 2  and for females ages 10 to 17. For Preventive services, allocations are only allowable for adolescents ages 5 to 14. All remaining OVC_SERV is automatically allocated to the Comprehensive service category. Red highlighting in the column, Comprehensive % of Total OVC_SERV, indicates cases where percentages are over 100% or less 0%. Review and adjust the column Targeted Graduation Rate among Comprehensive (%), which is preset at a default value of 20%, per guidance from O/GAC. Adjust these values as necessary to align with the COP 2021 OVC strategy. Graduation rates can be set at any value between 0-100% but should not be a negative value. Red highlights indicate percentages over 100% or less than 0%; yellow highlights indicate graduation rates less than 20%. Review modeled targets for Total OVC_SERV, which are calculated by applying the net rate of change decided in step 4 by the FY21 target referenced in step 3. In the case services are planned in FY22 where these were not provided in FY21, you may manually enter FY22 targets in this column. Review the number of OVC beneficiaries that are targeted by the DREAMS program COP21 implementation. This target is calculated by multiplying the total OVC_SERV target by the DREAMS % of Total OVC_SERV (%) set in step 5. This formula is also dependent on the input into column DREAMS SNU?, which must be marked with a Y to indicate the SNU is in fact a DREAMS SNU in order to set this target (see step 2). Review the number of OVC beneficiaries that are targeted by the OVC Preventive program COP21 implementation. This target is calculated by multiplying the total OVC_SERV target by the Preventive % of Total OVC_SERV (%), set in step 5. Review the number of OVC beneficiaries that are targeted for graduation from OVC Comprehensive services during COP21 implementation. This target is a calculated by multiplying the Total OVC_SERV target by the Comprehensive % of Total OVC_SERV (%) and Targeted Graduation Rate among Comprehensive (%). Review the targeted number of Active OVC Comprehensive beneficiaries for COP21. The Active OVC Comprehensive target is derived in the Data Pack as a remainder of Total OVC_SERV to be served via Comprehensive services, less those captured in the Comprehensive - Graduated target. To make changes to Comprehensive - Active targets in the Data Pack, adjust the proportion in the Comprehensive % of Total OVC_SERV (%) column, as set in step 5.

This tab is provided to facilitate and inform (1) data-driven program intent or relationships amongst indicators, where relevant, for KP programming and (2) easy review of all KP-related targets by virtue of having all KP-related targets in one tab. Importantly, pre-built algorithms and pre-set assumptions are NOT included in this tab. As such, entry of data into any columns labelled Assumptions or Projected MAY NOT automatically produce targets for the indicators listed. Considerations as you complete and use this tab: As per the COP21 Guidance, baseline data to support target development can come from bio-behavioral surveys (BBS) and size estimates, especially to understand current PLHIV burden and program results. Use the most recent and reliable estimates available where possible. For example, population size estimates and survey data on knowledge of status can inform PP_PREV and subsequent clinical cascade targets. Where possible and relevant, use FY21 targets and, as available, results to inform FY22 targets (the Assumption column for each indicator in the tab). But remember to consider expectations for scale-up based on current program needs and gaps. That is, FY20 results may not be the most relevant and appropriate base from which to develop FY22 targets. As per COP21 Guidance, OUs should strive to ensure all KPs reached with KP programming (KP_PREV), who do not already know their HIV status are either tested for HIV or actively referred for HIV testing. For clinical cascade indicators (HTS_TST, TX_NEW, etc.), consider the relationship amongst these indicators to ensure rates of linkage to treatment are in alignment with COP21 Guidance (i.e., high rates of linkage across all populations). Recognize that Key Population disaggregates are a SUBSET of the regular Age/Sex disaggregates. Each PSNU must have a total of relevant Age/Sex disaggregates of the same indicator for targeting process to be correct (e.g., 15+ Men for MSM). This is also an important factor to consider on the PSNU x IM tab. You may construct additional formulae in the far right of the tab to check this, but it will also be checked by the validation apps. Also note that IMs that do not provide actual clinical services cannot report TX_NEW or TX_CURR. While those IMs should track linkage in their own data systems, there is no relevant MER indicator for that data. 24.1 KP: KP_ESTIMATES E F G Column Name Host Country Est.

To receive and populate a Data Pack, follow the below instructions. 27.0.1 DATIM Import The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section: All mechanism integer value totals All deduplication proportions 27.1 Receiving a PSNU x IM Tab for the First Time Important Note: Adding data to the PSNUxIM tab of your Data Pack may cause the the filesize of your Data Pack to increase, sometimes significantly. As this may have implications for the performance of your Data Pack, it is recommended to run initial validations in the Self-Service App and ensure the Data Pack is in a good state of completeness prior to generating the PSNUxIM tab. Although the App will give the option to generate the PSNUxIM tab each time you validate your tool, it is not required to complete this step until you are fully prepared to begin the mechanism allocation process. Upon first receipt, the Data Pack will not contain a populated PSNU x IM tab. To receive a populated version of this tab, follow the below instructions: Submit a preliminary Data Pack for validation to the self-service validation tool at datapack.DATIM.org. The Data Pack Self-Service App will automatically detect that the PSNU x IM tab has not yet been populated and will do so, returning a new copy of the Data Pack with all other parts of the Data Pack left unaltered, but containing a populated PSNU x IM tab. Note that this new copy of your Data Pack will NOT automatically update any data derived from DATIM used across the rest of the Data Pack, such as previous years result or target data. To request a Data Pack with updated DATIM data, contact your PPM and assigned DUIT Liaison for approval, then submit a ticket to the Data Pack Support Team at DATIM.Zendesk.com. Download the new copy of your Data Pack generated by the Self-Service App and make it available to the rest of your team as appropriate. Review the initial PSNU x IM tab for any obvious errors made in the automated generation process. Flag any issues to the Data Pack Support Team at DATIM.Zendesk.com. In producing a PSNU x IM tab for the first time, the Data Pack Self-Service app will write data and formulas into this tab as follows: Each PSNU, with its parent SNU1. Data Pack Indicator Codes, which reference codes used throughout the Data Pack hidden in row 14 of on each tab. Age, Sex, &amp; Key Population for each sub-population, where specified. Total Data Pack Targets, as set in previous tabs of the Data Pack. In adding these targets, the Data Pack Self-Service App will write formulas allowing dynamic referencing of each target. In cases where additional updates to previous tabs of the Data Pack may be necessary, any updates to target values will automatically be updated on this tab in this column. Rollup totals, summing allocated targets across all mechanisms. This column can be helpful in quickly assessing whether Data Pack Target totals have been over- or under-allocated across DSD or TA, and IMs. Red highlighting indicates cases where Rollup sums differ from original Data Pack Target totals. Percentage allocations across IMs and DSD or TA, based on FY21 Target proportions as currently reported in DATIM. Note that these are based on a snapshot of DATIM taken at the time this data is originally written into the PSNU x IM tab. These allocation percentages will not automatically update once they have been first written into this tab. See below for how to either adjust existing allocations, or add new IMs and allocations to this section. Possible maximum and minimum Deduplicated Rollup Totals, Deduplicated DSD Totals, and Deduplicated TA Totals. Observed and Targeted Dedupe Resolution strategies as seen in DATIM-reported data for FY21 Targets, or based on allocations chosen in the Data Pack. See below for additional information. Duplicated Rollups, summing by DSD, TA, and Total across all allocated mechanisms. These data will automatically update as allocations are adjusted on this tab, or as total targets are adjusted on other tabs. IM-level Target Values, as integers, calculated by multiplying Data Pack Target totals by mechanism allocation percentages. 27.2 Adjusting IM Allocations To adjust, remove, and add allocations across Mechanisms in the PSNU x IM tab, follow the below instructions: Review initial allocations written automatically into the Data Pack based on patterns observed in FY21 Targets in DATIM. To adjust existing percentages, type over percentages already provided in the Data Pack with new percentages reflecting COP21 strategic programming. Note that these allocations are both to distribute targets to mechanisms as well as to distribute them across DSD and TA. In other words, in a case with no deduplication, allocations should sum to 100%, representing how each target will be divided both across mechanisms and by service type. To remove existing percentages, DO NOT DELETE COLUMNS. Instead, either replace the name of a mechanism in row 14 with a new name (following the format #####_DSD or #####_TA) and repurpose or replace the allocations in the rows below it, or delete all percentage allocations for a given mechanism  but keeping the mechanism name in row 14 the same  effectively withdrawing it from a certain geography or population or program area. To add new mechanisms for allocation, follow the below steps: Unhide the buffer of hidden green columns between pre-populated mechanism columns and the gray columns to the right describing Deduplicated Totals (Columns K  CG). Type the new mechanism name into the green cell in row 14, making sure to also denote the service type, whether DSD or TA. These names must be of the format: #####_DSD, or #####_TA. Do not leave any blank columns between mechanisms. Again, DO NOT DELETE COLUMNS. Confirm that mechanisms added here are entered in FACTS Info, approved, and valid for MER data entry for COP21. While there can be up to a 24 hour delay in synchronizing these mechanisms from FACTS Info to DATIM, as soon as a mechanism is added and approved and valid in FACTS Info, its 4-6 digit numeric code can be entered here in the Data Pack, and you can begin allocating targets to this new mechanism. However, note that in order to validate these data using the Data Pack Self-Service App, mechanisms must have already been synchronized from FACTS Info to DATIM. Validation alerts in the Data Pack Self-Service App will note where this may not be the case. Add allocations in the rows below any new mechanisms, making sure that new and old allocations still aggregate to no less than 100% allocation in all cases, and also no more than 100% allocation where no deduplication occurs. 27.3 Resolving Invalid Mechanism Errors The PNSUxIM tab will only populate with mechanisms that are marked as active for the current COP year in DATIM. Any mechanisms that are manually added by the user to to the PSNUxIM tab that are not active and valid will be flagged by the self-service app every time the user validates their tool. To ensure a mechanism is valid for the current COP year, go into the COP module in FACTS Info-Next Gen (FI-NG) and check the box for PEPFAR Systems Active Reporting Years for the appropriate COP year. Please note that it may take up to a day for active mechanism flags to be carried over into DATIM and clear up validation errors in the self-service app. 27.4 Note on Peace Corps Mechanisms For the COP21 planning cycle, Peace Corps will transition from reporting targets under their older mechanisms to reporting all targets under the Management &amp; Operations (M&amp;O) mechanisms. Note that the PSNUxIM tab will initially populate mechanisms and distributions based on previous year targets, so users must shift their Peace Corps targets to M&amp;O mechanisms from their previous mechanisms by changing the IM reference number at the top of the tab to the appropriate M&amp;O IM reference number. 27.5 Resolving Rounding Errors Due to the combination of multiplication of percentage values against target values coming from other parts of the Data Pack, and rounding of all mechanism target values to integers, target values allocated against mechanisms may roll up with some slight difference from Data Pack Targets. It may be necessary to iteratively adjust rounding errors and deduplications throughout the IM allocation process, though in general it is a good practice to resolve rounding errors as much as possible before moving on to deduplication. To resolve rounding errors, adjust percentages gradually, as follows: If you had previously unhid the buffer of green Percentage Allocation columns (the section between columns K and CG) while adding new mechanisms, or the Deduplication columns in columns CH to DB, it may be helpful to hide columns in these sections again now to more easily see both Percentage Allocations and Target Values at the same time on your screen. It may also be helpful to review Duplicated Rollup values in columns DC to DE in addition to Data Pack Targets in column I so as to consider rounding errors distinctly from the impacts of deduplication. Note that all when first produced, the PSNUxIM tab applies no initial deduplication, so Total Duplicated Rollups and Data Pack Targets will match when first received. While maintaining overall distribution patterns as intended, gradually adjust percentage allocations under affected mechanisms in columns K through CG to increase or decrease Duplicated Rollups as needed. Note that while all rounding errors should be resolved if possible, a small margin of error around some values is permissible, so long as this does not exceed an absolute value of 2 in either direction of the Data Pack Target in column I. 27.6 Performing Deduplication Follow the below steps to perform all Deduplication associated with IM allocations of targets. Note that due to improvements to the COP21 Data Pack and close alignment with DATIM, performing deduplications in the Data Pack resolves the need to perform any deduplication in DATIM. If you had previously unhid the buffer of green Percentage Allocation columns (columns K  CG), it may be helpful to hide empty columns in this section again now. Review Duplicated Rollups for DSD, TA, and total targets, beginning in column DC. These are dynamically summed across all mechanism targets allocated in the PSNU x IM tab to the right of these columns. To adjust these totals, return to the Percentage Allocation section. Review TA Deduplication in columns CV to DB, DSD Deduplication in columns CO to CU, and Crosswalk Deduplication in columns CH to CN (recommended in that order for each row): Where only a single mechanism is assigned targets under either DSD or TA (for DSD and TA Deduplication), where deduplicated DSD and TA totals (see column CH) aggregate to less than or equal to Data Pack targets (for Crosswalk Deduplication), or where total mechanism targets (column DC) aggregate to less than or equal to Data Pack Targets (column I), gray highlighting in these sections indicates that deduplication is not necessary or permitted. Review allowable ranges for possible deduplicated totals by referencing the SUM and MAX rollup columns. As in the DATIM Deduplication App, SUM values represent cases with zero deduplication, and MAX rollups represent application of the most deduplication possible, resulting in values equivalent to the largest IM target among either the DSD or TA mechanisms (for DSD or TA deduplication), or the larger of either DSD or TA deduplicated totals (for crosswalk deduplication). Review Observed Dedupe Resolutions seen in FY21 Target allocations. These are provided for reference, and indicate which deduplication approach was used in FY21 Target deduplication, performed in the DATIM Deduplication App. For cases where Custom deduplication was used in FY21 Targets, review the Custom Dedupe Allocation observed in FY21 Targets. Percentages here are calculated by dividing the DSD or TA deduplication value (for DSD or TA deduplication) or the sum of Deduplicated DSD and Deduplicated TA (for crosswalk deduplication) by the sum of all mechanisms and deduplication values, across both DSD and TA. As such, these values are all negative or zero, and can be easily compared against target allocation percentages used in columns K  CG. In columns CZ for TA, CS for DSD, and CL for Crosswalk, manually type the deduplication resolution approach to be used to resolve deduplication issues, as follows: CUSTOM or custom or Custom SUM or sum or Sum MAX or max or Max Where Custom deduplication is selected, also indicate the percentage allocation to be assigned to the deduplication value in the column to the immediate right. Again, a reminder that these values should all be negative or zero, and represent the proportion of deduplication values relative to the Data Pack Target total in column I. Initially upon indicating Custom deduplication, the Data Pack will preset this deduplication allocation equal to the value observed in FY21 Targets, if any. You may alter and adjust this value as needed, so long as it is negative or zero. Also note that it is not enough to only type in a percentage deduplication allocation; you must also enter CUSTOM, SUM, or MAX, as explained in the previous step. Note that instead of entering SUM, it is possible to enter CUSTOM but enter a deduplication percentage allocation of 0%; and instead of entering MAX, it is possible to enter CUSTOM but enter a deduplication percentage allocation that results in the equivalent of the MAX value shown in columns CI, CP, or CW. Review the Rollup values in column J for any mismatch against Data Pack Targets in column I that may necessitate adjustment of Deduplication allocations. Note that while it is not a strict requirement that percentage allocations across mechanisms and deduplication add to 100%, it is a requirement that integer values add to equal the Data Pack Target in column I, ± 2. Red highlights in column J indicate values more than 2 (integer, absolute value) away from the Data Pack Targets in column I; yellow highlights indicate values 1 or 2 (integer, absolute value) away from the Data Pack Targets column I.
