Click on either choice to reach the following sections:

1.  Key Indicators

-   Current ART Coverage

-   National Total on ART

-   Expected PEPFAR_TX_CURR

-   Est. Current HIV Prevalence Rate

2.  Targeted PEPFAR TX_CURR Rates of Change (FY20 to FY21)

-   Teams can use this panel to set initial broad FY20-21 growth rates
    for PEPFAR TX_CURR. Adjust default values to reflect program
    intention. This growth rate table is optional for SNUs who want to
    make broad increases across prioritization level.

-   Whether users make changes, all uses should navigate to the TX tab
    to refine growth rates by age/sex and PSNU.

-   Changes are made in TX tab will overwrite any changes in this panel.
    After changes are made in the TX tab, the panel will NO LONGER
    affect the final targeted growth rates on the TX tab.
