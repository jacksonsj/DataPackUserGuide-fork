# AGYW

This year’s AGYW_PREV Tab is updated to incorporate results from the DREAMS R-Shiny Saturation Application for OUs that choose to utilize it. There are two paths an OU can take to generate COP23 AGYW_PREV Targets – Path 1 for those using outputs from the R-shiny App and Path 2 for those not using outputs from the R-Shiny App. 

**Column F Est. Female Population**

The R-Shiny App can be used to generate the AGYW population by 5-year age bands in the absence of Spectrum data aggregated to the necessary geographic level for the 25–29-year-old age band. The population data source in the R-shiny App is from the US Census Bureau.**If your OU has a different source you’d prefer, please provide the proper justification to your DUIT Liaison during the Target Setting Tool Review**  
  
  

**Column G:  H.C. Est # of Vulnerable AGYW (FY23)**  
  
-   Path 1: Please enter the estimated number of vulnerable (DREAMS eligible) AGYW by age/PSNU into the column from the R-Shiny App  
-   Path 2: Estimate vulnerable AGYW by using =F*Proxy Vulnerability Estimator  
   
**Column H: DREAMS Sat App Percent Coverage – Saturation (%) FY22**  

This is the estimated percent saturated.  
-   Path 1:This estimate can come from the R-Shiny App output directly.  
-   Path 2: If app is not used, in-country DREAMS databases can be utilized and path to determine this saturation percentage should be submitted as a narrative to DUIT Liaison.  
  
**Column I: DREAMS Sat App DREAMS Eligible Girls Not Yet Reached FY22**  

-   Path 1: This column can be copied directly from the app.
-   Path 2:  Populate this column with the following formula:  =**(F*G*H)**. This will determine the number of DREAMS Eligible AGYW. For both paths it is necessary to calculate this column. 

 
 



## AGYW: AGYW_PREV

**AGYW_PREV:** Number of active DREAMS beneficiaries that have started
or completed any DREAMS service/intervention as of the end of the
reporting period.

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
sheet_name <- "AGYW"
section <- "AGYW_PREV"
columns <- col_seq("F", "V")
data <- prepare_table_data(sheet_name, columns)
for (t in table_seq(data, max_col = 4)) {
  make_table(t, section)
  }
```

### DATIM Import

The following data points will be imported into DATIM from this section:

-   **Denominator - Started or Completed any DREAMS Service**
    $AGYW\_PREV.D.T$

-   **Numerator - Completed at least Primary Package** $AGYW\_PREV.N.T$

### Instructions

1.  For historical context, review Host Country Estimated Female
    Population for FY22, which is referenced from the Cascade tab.

2.  Enter values for the Host Country Estimated Number of Vulnerable
    AGYW projected as of September 2021, as available. These are for
    reference and not used to model targets in proceeding steps.

3.  For context, review FY23 targets for PrEP_NEW, PrEP_CT, PP_PREV,
    HTS_TST_POS, and HTS_TST, set in other tabs of the DatatPack.

4.  For additional context, review FY21 results for AGYW_PREV and
    Observed Percent Completion as reported in DATIM.

5.  Review and adjust assumptions for Projected Net Change in Total
    AGYW_PREV from FY21 Results (%). This is defaulted to 0%, but can be
    adjusted as necessary. Red highlights indicate percentages over
    100%; yellow highlights indicate percentages less than 100% but not
    0%.

6.  Review and adjust assumptions for Targeted Percent Completion. This
    is defaulted to 60%, but can be adjusted as necessary. Red
    highlights indicate percentages over 100%; yellow highlights
    indicate percentages less than 60%.

7.  Review modeled FY23 targets for AGYW_PREV Denominator and Numerator,
    and return to steps 1-6 to adjust values as necessary. See below for
    additional information.

\*Note: AGYW_PREV is reported by the USG team, not an IM, it doesn't
have to be assigned to an IM. It is automatically assigned to USG team,
and will not appear in the PSNUxIM tab for target allocation.

### AGYW_PREV Denominator (FY23)

FY23 targets for AGYW_PREV Denominator are set as follows, rounding to
the nearest integer:

$$
{AGYW\_ PREV.D}_{t}\  = \ {AGYW\_ PREV.D}_{r}\ *\\
(1\  + \ {Projected\ Net\ Change\ in\ Total\ AGYW\_ PREV}_{t})
$$

Note that neither this target nor the target for AGYW_PREV Numerator are
disaggregated by Service or Package Completion Status.

### AGYW_PREV Numerator (FY23)

FY23 Targets for AGYW_PREV Numerator are similarly modeled very simply
as follows, rounding to the nearest integer:

$$
{AGYW\_ PREV.N}_{t}\  = \ {AGYW\_ PREV.D}_{t}\ *\ \text{Targeted Percent Completion}_{t} 
$$ \elandscape
